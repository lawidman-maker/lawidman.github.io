					<h3><em>Hiking and Paddleboarding</em></h3>
					<p>
					<strong>Panther Island Pavillion, Downtown</strong><br>
					<img src="panther.png" alt="Panther Island" height="100" width="300"><br>
					Panther Island doubles as the ultimate outdoor sport area and live music venue. They host a ton of concerts
					every year and also have walking and biking trails, paddleboard and kayak rentals, and a bike share station.
					Panther Island is Downtown, right on the Trinity River. Perfect for a day of adventures!<br>

					<strong>Shady Grove Park, North Side</strong><br>
					<img src="shady.jpg" alt="Shady Grove" height="200" width="200"><br>
					Come here to feed the ducks, launch off with your kayak or paddleboard, and enjoy the park.
					This is the easiest place to launch for water sports that dont include a boat, and there are
					plenty of picnic tables to enjoy a snack when you get off the water.<br>

					<strong>Eagle Mountain Lake Trails, North Side</strong><br>
					<img src="eaglemtn.jpg" alt="Eagle Mountain" height="200" width="200"><br>
					Eagle Mountain has multiple hiking trails for all levels, and all have incredible views of the water. 
					The Northwest Trail is probably the most difficult, and the terrain is rocky and all hills. Its worth
					the view though, as you can see.<br>
					<a href="https://eaglemountainlake.org/">Eagle Mountain</a><br><br>
					
					<strong>Marion Sansom Park, North Side</strong><br>
					<img src="paddleboard.jpg" alt="Marion Sansom" height="200" width="200"><br>
					This 260 acre park overlooks Lake Worth on top of a limestone bluff. It is as breaktaking as it sounds, 
					and if you're lucky, the waterfall is flowing.<br>

					<h3><em>Tennis and Pickleball</em></h3>
					<p>
					<strong>Courtside Kitchen, University</strong><br>
					<img src="courtside.png" alt="Courtside" height="200" width="200"><br>
					Not far from both Quince and Woodshed, Courtside Kitchen doubles as a pickelball court as well as a
					brunch/lunch stop. You can just book a court, or enjoy the amenities!<br>
					<a href="https://www.courtsidekitchenfw.com/">Courtside Kitchen</a><br><br>
					
					<strong>McLeland Tennis Center, South Fort Worth</strong><br>
					McLeland Tennis Center has great courts, great staff, and isn't far from Tacos Oasis. 
					You can book courts for fun, book lessons, or even join a league if you're looking for one! They also 
					have pickleball, as most tennis courts around here will!<br>
					<a href="https://www.impactactivities.com/mcleland">McLeland Tennis Center</a><br><br>
					
					<strong>Southlake Tennis Center, Southlake</strong><br>
					Another great spot for Tennis and Pickleball, and while not necessarily a hidden gem, it's close to Southlake
					Town Square, and a Southlake Favorite, Cork & Pig Tavern. <br>

					<h3><em>Think Outside the Box</em></h3>
					<p>
					<strong>SiNaCa Studios, Magnolia</strong><br>
					<img src="sinaca.png" alt="Sinaca Studios" height="100" width="300"><br>
					We came here for a compnay Christmas party a few years ago and it was one of the most incredible experiences.
					They have group packages as well as date night ones. You actually get to blow your own glass piece, but you 
					have to be in town to pick it up after. So consider doing this early in your trip if you are only here for 
					a few days.<br>
					<a href="https://sinacastudios.org/">Sinaca Studios</a><br><br>
					
					<strong>Quiggley's Clayhouse, University</strong><br>
					<img src="quiggleys.png" alt="Quiggleys Clayhouse" height="100" width="300"><br>
					Another spot where you get to make your own creations! But here, you can opt to just paint one of their already
					pre-made pieces, or make your own! Though pretending like you're in the movie Ghost is probably not advised.<br>
					<a href="https://quigglys.com/">Quiggley's</a><br><br>
					
					<strong>PinStripes, Clearfork</strong><br>
					PinStripes is a bowling alley nestled inside of an incredible restaurant. Brunch, dinner, late night drinks, it's
					all here. Clearfork is also an amazing walk and shop spot, so you could spend the day here if you really want to!<br>
