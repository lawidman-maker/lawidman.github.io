					<p>Hey there! I'm Lindsey. While I've only been in Fort Worth for 10 years, I feel like this is and has always been my home.
	I moved to Fort Worth from Northeastern Pennsylvania in 2016. Scranton, to be exact... any Office fans?! 
	I decided in my mid-twenties that snow was just not my thing. I wanted sunshine and a good time. 
	I set my eyes on Texas, got a job, and never went back. 
	<br><br>
	I feel like once you hit the 10-year mark, you’re considered a local. At least by my standards anyway. 
	Besides, what’s the point of living somewhere and calling it home if you can’t call yourself a local?! 
	I love this city with all my heart. It’s got the heart and charm of a small town nestled in a huge metropolitan area.
	I am an active person. I love hiking, paddleboarding, running (kinda), roller-skating, playing tennis, pickleball, and the list goes on.
	I’m outside, okay? Like… a lot. It's my favorite thing. My second favorite thing? Eating. Everything. All the time. I love food, and Fort Worth has it all. 
	From pasta to tacos to thai and even espresso martinis and girl dinner!
	<br><br>
	So, while gatekeeping my favorite spots sounds like a good idea, I can’t do that to y’all. It took me FOREVER to navigate this place when I 
	first moved here, so I’ve decided to break it down into categories, and then I’ll tag the general area of the city they are in. You can choose 
	a place to have fun, shop, and eat and know you’re not accidentally driving across town at rush hour on a Friday. Have you seen 35?!
	<br><br>
	Hopefully these places that are near and dear to my heart will inspire you to explore the city and find your own faves. 
	<br><br>
	Happy Adventures!<br>
	xo, Lindsey
